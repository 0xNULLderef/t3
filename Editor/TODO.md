## Refactor project handling 

x Remove GraphWindow.CanOpenAnotherWindow
- Prevent last project window from being closed
x Show project after NewProjectDialog -> ProjectManager.TryOpenInstancePath().
- Test AppMenu -> New Graph Window

- fix view regions when navigating in/out
- unload projects from project list
- somewhat presentable project list
