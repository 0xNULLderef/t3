# Tooll 3 - A realtime animation toolkit



## Installation

As of now there is no stand-alone version available. This means that you need an IDE like Visual Studio or Rider to build and run it. This is free and not as difficult as it might sound.

1. If you don't have a .net IDE installed already download and install the [Community Edition of Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). 
2. Download and install a git client like https://git-fork.com/
3. Clone the git repository https://github.com/still-scene/t3
   1. Make sure to update the submodules [Operators](https://github.com/still-scene/Operators) and [Resources](https://github.com/still-scene/Resources)

4. Open `t3.sln`
5. Start the application either in AnyCPU / Debug or Release mode
