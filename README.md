# Tooll 3 - A realtime animation toolkit


## Installation

As of now there is no stand-alone version available. This means that you need an IDE like Visual Studio or Rider to build and run it. This is free and not as difficult as it might sound.

1. If you don't have a .net IDE installed already download and install the [Community Edition of Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). 
2. Download and install a git client like https://git-fork.com/

### Cloning the git repository
1. Download and install https://git-fork.com/
 

#### If you don't have a git account 
Ideally, it would be better to sign-up. It's free and only takes a minute or so. This will allow you share your changes with the community.

   1. If you have a git account, we recommend using ssh:
      ```git clone 
      ```
