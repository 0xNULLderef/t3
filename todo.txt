todo:
/ Combine as new type
- Put operators assembly into own repo as submodule
- Add color grade op
- Add first player version
- Add first sound integration
- Replace Guids with uint ids during runtime
- Showing enums produces always the same code, extract function for this and even better cached object per enum type
- Make all tests in CoreTests runnable again
- Make remove connection command applicable for lists of connections
- Change input value command must take default value into account
- Create missing commands - set default value, set back to default, set input parameters
- Restructure connections to have an easier handling for multi inputs etc
- How to visualize input connection evaluation
- Move Roslyn integration to UI project
 
done:
* Duplicate as new type
* General op replacement/compilation after change
* fix reassigning connections to multi input after re-compilation
* order the connections that these are not stored in different order after recompilation
* How to animate struct type like Vec3 or Color
* Fix exception when removing and input/output in code and restarting
* Add remaining things to compute shader stage (missing multi inputs, dispatch count etc)
* Add copy operator functionality
* Fixed loading the same texture file from different instances (currently 2nd one is rejected)
* Clean up multi input handling for graph invalidation
* Remove abstract Slot class and replace with ISlot
* Reactivate dirty flag
* Integrate graph traversal
* Move operators out of Core directory
* Integrate animation handling incl. load/store
* Test animation specific update action replace in slot
* Fixed showing normal inputs when the input parameters are shown for a specific input
* Moved save/load of InputUi properties to the class itself
* Add load/save for input parameter options like Relevancy and Min/Max
* Add path parameter options for string type
* Operator with complex output type e.g. list (added multi input float -> list and list select op)
* Make test for dirty flag runnable again
* Fix undo of delete several operators with several multi input connections
* Fixed multi input index calculation when adding connections
* Added delete operator command that works with collections
* Add delete operator code (without command)
* Add 'remove connection command'
* Add 'add connection command'
* Fix adding/removing/changing input value done with undo/redo several times
* Add Id property to InputUi and OutputUi to enabled tracking if an Symbol.(Input|Output) is not existing anymore
* Fix selection of input nodes
* Apply ChangeSelectableCommand for Input/Outputs too and extract command UI code for all 3 usages
* Crash when adding connection to StringConcat
* Make ChangeSelectableCommand working
* Move undo redo stack to T3 project
* Restructure UI elements
